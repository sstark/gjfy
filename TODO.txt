# Rework 2.0

- Use spf13/cobra for command line flags. ✅
- Single binary with multiple functionality:
    * `gjfy server` the current "classic" mode. ✅
    * `gjfy token <add|delete>` manage user tokens.
    * `gjfy secret <add>` add secrets. Replaces the shell script.
    * `gjfy db <export|import>` dumps or imports the current secret db from memory.
        + Idea is to be able to restart gjfy without losing secrets.
- Consider dropping TLS support.
    * This has never been a good feature, and this should be really done by a
      reverse proxy with proper certificate management.
    * Downside is that for api actions like `gjfy secret` we lose TLS or have
      to setup a reverse proxy even for testing.
- Use `go embed` for logo and html template. ✅
- Split project in packages ✅
- Fix deprecated io/ioutil usage ✅
- Improve test coverage
- Use a more standard mechanism for sending token
- Make separate api and user http handlers
